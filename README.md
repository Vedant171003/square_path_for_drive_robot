# square_path_for_drive_robot
The "holonomic_drive_robot_controller" repository contains a ROS2 node that provides commands to control a holonomic drive robot to move in a square path.
Overview
This ROS2 node is designed to control a holonomic drive robot to move in a square path in a simulated environment. The node utilizes the ROS2 ecosystem and the Twist message to send velocity commands to the robot, enabling it to move in different directions.

Features
Square Path Movement: The node generates velocity commands to make the holonomic drive robot move in a square path.
ROS2 Compatibility: Developed using ROS2 for compatibility with the latest ROS distribution.
Simple Control Interface: Provides an easy-to-use interface to control the robot's movement.
Installation
To use this node, follow these steps:

Clone the repository into your ROS2 workspace:
bash
Copy code
cd ros2_workspace/src
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/holonomic_drive_robot_controller.git
Build your ROS2 workspace:
bash
Copy code
cd ros2_workspace
colcon build
Usage
To run the node and make the holonomic drive robot move in a square path, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
ros2 run holonomic_drive_robot_controller square_path_controller_node
This will start the node, which will then generate velocity commands to move the robot in a square path.

Additional Information
For more detailed information on the node's functionality, usage instructions, or any inquiries, please refer to the documentation or contact the project maintainers.
